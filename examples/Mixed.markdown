Level 1 Heading
===============

This is an example.

## A subheading

That should be normalized to an setext style heading,

Some _for_ breakfast:

Italics in that sentance should remain underscores.

\begin{image}
\includegraphics{haskell.png}
\end{image}

Whitespace here should be preserved.

### Third level heading

An image tag should be unchanged, but this being a long paragraph with long lines
should be rewrapped to be under 75 characters.

![](haskell.png)

because it's immutable.
