Background
==========

Web pages on are the global standard for displaying and searching
information but authoring content for them in raw HTML is tedious; this led
to the advent of lightweight markup formats like Markdown that could easily
be converted to HTML (it is no co-incidence that they represent documents
using formatting conventions prevelant in the early days of the internet
when users conveyed semantic information in text based mailing lists and
usenet newsgroups using such lightweight markup).

Somewhat surprisingly, the web continues to struggle with taking content
into print form. Perhaps browsers are so overwhelmed by their own success;
certainly many people are happy to read content on screens surrounded by
flashy banner ads.

For certain audiences, however, getting high-quality printed output on
**paper** (or at least in a form that _could_ be printed to paper). These
users include researchers needing to document results, business and
organizations wishing to circulate content for review and approval, writers
wishing to produce their work in manuscript form suitable for editing, and
publishers needing to take content and actually do pre-press rendering into
a form "camera ready".
