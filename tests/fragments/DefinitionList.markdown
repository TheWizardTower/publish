Definition lists (called description lists in LaTeX) are funny!

First

:   Some text. That was a demonstration of the power of main but even despite
    the evidence before your eyes most of you will disbelieve.

Secondly

:   Some terms need further explanation.

    With details!

:   Apparently including extra definitions? What does that even mean?

Third

:   It is undeniable that the left fold is superior to the right fold but only
    if it strictly adheres to the laws laid down in holy scripture. Should the
    warnings of Saint Simon not be respected, you can expect a great rising of
    space leaking from the firey depths of your deepest darkest memory heap.

Done.
