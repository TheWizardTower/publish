Some people just can't resist:

<form action="/hero.php" method="post">

I don't know what I'm doing. Do you <input type="text" name="question"> have
the **foggiest** idea? Not that this is a standard Markdown Paragraph block
with Markdown inlines. The HTML input tag above is treated as an inline.

</form>

I'm not thrilled about the newlines separating the HTML block elements from
the following ones, but leaving it this way emphasizes that it's not one
container block (as it is in HTML) but rather the open and close tags are
individual independant Markdown Raw blocks.

But you <i>never</i> know.
