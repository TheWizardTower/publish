Simple list:

 -  This is the first item
 -  This is the second item

Simple list with longer lines:

 -  This is a third item which rambles on and and on and then has some more
    text which goes on.
 -  And this is the fourth item, enough of that.

We also have more complex bullet lists:

 -  This is the fifth item;

 -  This is the sixth item, which has lots of words about current events
    and learned discussion about whether the stock market will go up or
    down depending on whether the `launchTheMissiles()` function gets
    called today or tomorrow; and

 -  Finally, a 7th item. Wasn't there a book about Seven Signs? Maybe it
    was _Seven Samurai_.

And we're done.
