Some people think Haskell is a difficult language to understand. They're
right:

```haskell
x = Right "This is too hard"

mail :: IO ()
main = print x
```

But only a little right. If they were `Left` it would be easy.

If you don't want to say the language you speak:

```
This might be text
```

that's ok.
